I used to **love** playing around with my [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) installation and making it look cool. I did all sorts of crazy things with it and once I have even submitted my configuration to [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/2m3zgv/pantheon_first_time_i_feel_confident_enough_with/) and [/r/cyberpunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/2m6cpt/someone_suggested_i_should_also_post_this_here/). Oddly enough, I received ~200 reputation on those two subreddits and I was really proud of myself at the time. I loved playing around with Linux because... well... I could.

Then, I've started being a bit more active on elementary's [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104613975513761463450) and later on on its [StackExchange site](http://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/). I tried to keep my system as close to the default one as I felt comfortable with. I usually have just picked some custom wallpaper, put the Plank (the dock) on the left side of the screen and put it in the autohide mode. I didn't use any custom themes or anything. The reason for this decision is that I wanted to be able to reproduce the elementary OS issues others were experiencing so I could help them out. It worked great, but it felt... boring.

Then, I have installed Fedora as my secondary operating system just so I can play with it. Unfortunately, I didn't feel at home there. There's nothing wrong with Fedora. It works great! _But_, I so got used to using Ubuntu and its `apt-get` that I just can't convince myself to try anything else.

So, I've spent a couple of more months using just plain default elementary OS. Recently, I kind of got bored again with its look. So, I have decided to do what every insane person would do: try to use some WM instead of a DE!

Oddly enough, about the same time, [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf) explaining `i3` in a three video long playlist came up in my Google+ news feed. I've spent some time looking at the first and the second video and then I have decided to go with it and see what will I accomplish once I'm finished following the things from the tutorial(s).

So, I went ahead and installed [i3](http://i3wm.org/). Now the videos _are_ absolutely amazing, but since you have to log out and back in more then a couple of times to apply some of the changes in the `i3`, I have spent quite some time looking at them.

Of course, you could kind of circumvent this by having two laptops or something, but since I had just one laptop and I wanted to test `i3` on a real hardware instead of playing with it inside of a virtual machine, that had to be done.

Anyway, I have `i3` installed for about seven days already. I kind of found a sweet spot where I'm using `i3` every time I don't have a second monitor with me (at home) and Pantheon every time I have a second monitor with me (at work). I got used to its commands, but I have never took the time to "rice" my desktop to look more appealing to me. Until today, that is.

So, what I did is I have put a couple of applications (Firefox, Terminator, Atom, Thunderbird and Spotify) to autostart as soon as I start my `i3`. They each have their own workspace accompanied with a couple of icons from the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) pack so I have a nice visual reminder of what's located in a specific workspace. That way, switching between them is surprisingly easy.

I've put my bar on the top, because, well, I got used to having the bar on the top since I've been using Pantheon for a couple of years.

I have chosen to manually compile i3 gaps. While doing so, [this article](http://ttrmw.co.uk/linux/i3_gaps_ubuntu.html) has been more then helpful.
