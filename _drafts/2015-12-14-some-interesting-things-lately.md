# Some interesting things I've been working on lately

All right, I think it is fair to start this post by saying that, back in the last week of October, I actually got a first internship opportunity! I have joined [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project](https://www.occrp.org/en) as their very first intern in the tech department. Now, before I go any further, I'm going to do my best to [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) what is this organization and how does it work.

So, Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (or OCCRP in short, which is how I'm going to refer to it further in this post) is a non-profit journalistic network. It has [a lot of members](https://www.occrp.org/en/about-us) that you've probably never heard of _unless_ you're actually living in a country where those members are operating, so I'm just going to say that we're currently operating mostly in Eastern parts of Europe and some parts of Asia (to name some of the countries just so you can get the idea: Bosnia & Herzegovina, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Hungary, Macedonia, Montenegro, Georgia, Czech Republic, Kosovo...). What we're basically doing is trying to combine investigative journalism (that usually takes months to write a single story) with the Internet, and, as it turns out, that's really not an easy task.

Now, as I found out, pro-government media tends to like calling our staff names. Here, I'll give you a couple of examples (that are written in languages I actually understand): Serbian portal [e-novine](http://www.e-novine.com/kolumna/petar-lukovic/102024-Zato-kae-Miranda-misli-sex.html) basically made a 2000+ word long _highly_ sexist article about one of our lead reporters without actually making any point, Serbian tabloid [Informer](http://www.informer.rs/print/35560/vesti/politika/35560/ON-PRAVI-HAOS-I-LANSIRA-AFERE-Ovo-je-Amerikanac-koji-vodi-specijalni-rat-protiv-Srbije) said that OCCRP's co-founder is "battling a special war against Serbia", Bosnian newspaper [Avaz](http://www.avaz.ba/clanak/134294/dru-saliven-je-komedijas-za-medijsko-reketiranje) said that our co-founder is basically blackmailing people... Anyway, our reporters kind of learned a lot about themselves from other sources.

To make the things a bit more scary, one of our reporters from Azerbaijan, called [Khadija Ismayilova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadija_Ismayilova) got arrested by the police in Azerbaijan and has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.

So, why does such an organization have a need for the IT department?

Well, first of all, OCCRP introduced some very interesting tools to the public. I'll name a few of them:
