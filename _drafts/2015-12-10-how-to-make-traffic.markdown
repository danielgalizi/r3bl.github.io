Allright, so, I've spent like a year and a half thinking about how to grow traffic on my blog and actually accomplishing it. So today, after I have read another bullshit article about doing a proper [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) before saying: "Fuck it. I'll do my own tutorial." So, the point of this post is to break the barriers of standard marketing advices and show you how to accomplish the most with a very limited budget (as in, $0 because the US-based services don't support your credit card).

Now before we go any further, I wanna set one thing straight: my website is receiving a solid amount of traffic. Not a huge amount of traffic, but a solid one. I'm talking about 150-200 visits per day, and, [according to Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/r3bl.me), it's amongst the top 2.5 million websites there is. Now, before you say that's not a lot, keep in mind that there's [about a billion websites](www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) out there and that my `.me` domain is just a couple of months old (registered [in August](http://whois.domaintools.com/r3bl.me), to be more precise). So, how did I get to where I'm here?

## 1. Don't worry about the topics

Really, write about whatever you want to write. I'm kind of lucky here, because this is my personal domain, but the point is clear: forget about the targeted audience, forget about approaching a certain type of people. Just write about whatever pops into your mind at the moment. Just don't give a shit. If you write about a specific topic (let's say, open source software), your website is only going to be appealing to a certain type of people (in this case, open source enthusiasts). If you write about lots and lots of topics, you're going to be approach to more than one type of people.

## 2. Don't worry about the time of publishing your posts

Really, don't. Just post when the post you've prepared is ready. Monday morning, Friday afternoon, it really does not make a difference. Thanks to the algorithms implemented in our favorite social networks (like Facebook or Google+), a certain amount of people is going to see your post regardless of when you post them. You can post them at 4 AM (in fact, I've done so on more than one occasion), share them on Facebook, and, a couple of hours later, when people actually wake up, they'll see your post in their news feed.

## 3. Don't give a fuck about the money

I thought of making money from my blog in like forever. But the thing is -- I don't actually give a shit. I _know_ that you cannot make a significant amount of money out of blogging unless your blog is receiving thousands of visits _per day_. As an example, the website I'm collaborating with ([Kompjuteras.com](https://kompjuteras.com/)), is, according to Alexa, amongst the top 1 million websites in the world. According to the owner of that domain himself, he's only making ~100-200 Euros per year out of it. That's barely enough to pay for the yearly costs of the website. He's not really profiting out of it.

The thing is that I really don't want to make money out of running a website. To make money, I would actually have to have a targeted audience and to post about a specific topic with a certain regularity in my publishing. Fuck that! There are certain things that are even more satisfying than making money (like, [being mentioned in a research paper](http://www.giswatch.org/node/5243), or being a [guest speaker at a nationally broadcasted talk show](http://www.tv1.ba/produkcija/formati/ja-biram-goste/3945-ja-biram-goste.html)). Sure, having a steady amount of money is nice, but it's kind of not worth it in my opinion. So, I simply don't give a fuck about the money and I feel great about doing so.

I cannot say that I'm not thinking about serving ads. _But_, I'm thinking about serving ads to the specific projects I like to gain more traffic to them instead of actually making money out of serving them. That way, I would actually support the projects I actually like instead of reserving space on my blog to products I don't really like, recommend or use myself.

## 4. Don't worry about subdomains

It's perfectly fine if the majority of your web traffic is populated by a subdomain. That's exactly the case here, on a website you're currently reading. My `blog.r3bl.me` subdomain generates more than 90% of my overall traffic.

## 5. Promote the shit out of your website

You don't need ads for this. All you really need is a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) account. Literally. No matter what you're writing about, there's a subreddit dedicated for that with a couple of dozens of thousands of subscribers. So, when you post something that you _think_ is worth posting to a specific subreddit, feel free to do so. It's not really against the rules to do so. Just, please, don't spam the shit out of reddit with your every post. Find a specific post that you like a lot and post it to a subreddit it belongs to. Nothing bad about that. If the topic you're writing about has another dedicated community (like, for example, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), take advantage of that).

## 6. Have at least one killer post each quarter

I haven't actually posted anything in ~2 months, but I'm still receiving the steady amount of monthly traffic each day. The reason for that is that the last post I have published practically broke all of the traffic barriers I had before. I felt comfortable about that and I have just prolonged writing things for some time.

So, how do you _know_ which post is going to be a killer one? You don't. You just have to wait and see.

## 7. Don't worry about your English skills

A year and a half ago, when I have started actually writing things on my ancient WordPress.com domain, my English skills were pretty bad. Before that, I have never had a chance to actually speak to someone where our only way of communicating is in English. After that, I have volunteered in the Netherlands for a month, so I was kind of forced to use English, and right now, I've started working in an international company that has an office in my country, so I'm once more forced to start speaking English.
