**NOTE:** As of June 18th (2015), this page contains more personalized version of the story of my life. If you want to see what I had actually done as an open source advocate, check out [my portfolio](https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/en/portfolio). Alternatively, you can see the short version of my portfolio by downloading my resume (available in both [English](https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/assets/portfolio-en.pdf)
and [Bosnian](https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/assets/portfolio-bs.pdf) language).

## Short version

I'm [an Open Source Advocate](http://r3bl.github.io/en/open-source-advocacy) with a huge passion for artificial intelligence and information security. I'm a Community Moderator at [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com/). I love contributing to open source projects, mostly [without writing code](http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code). I've contributed to a couple of worldy-known open source projects such as [reddit](https://reddit.com/), [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), and the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org). I'm writing content in both English and Bosnian language. I wrote content for various online publications (to see the full list of articles I wrote for other websites, [click here](https://r3bl.me)).

## Long version

I like writing. I started writing back in 2013 when I started contributing to [LiBRE! magazine](https://libre.lugons.org/) (regional digital free software magazine written in Serbian language). Then, in July 2014, I started my own blog. My blog was previously hosted [on Wordpress.com domain](http://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/) before I decided to migrate it to GitHub Pages + Jekyll combination back in January (2015). In June (2015), I took my writing skills to a whole new level by joining [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com) as their new Community Moderator. You can read my announcement and my initial impressions [here](https://r3bl.github.io/en/partnership-with-opensource-dot-com/).

Apart from writing, I live an open source life. I'm using open source technologies every day and I contribute to open source software as much as I can (which is _at least_ once a week). I don't really consider myself a noteworthy programmer because I didn't write any program worth mentioning so far. (But I am working on it!)

Even though I didn't write any useful code so far, that didn't stop me from contributing to open source software. I started back in 2013 by joining the reddit's translation team to help them to translate their service to Serbian language.

I speak three languages on a native level: Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. And no, I'm not a _big_ fan of learning new languages. Those three languages are pretty much the same (with _very_ small differences), we just call them differently because of the political reasons. I posses dual citizenship from Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina. I'm also speaking English on a professional level (or at least I hope so) and I know a bit of German and Dutch as well.

I like reading books. I like watching Science Fiction movies. I'm even trying to write a book in my free time, but judging by the way I started, I'm not sure will I ever publish it.

My journey in the Linux world began two years ago (yes, 2013 was a life-changing year for me). I started learning about infosec (or whatever you want to call the security field) and soon enough I started experimenting with different Linux distros. I started with Kali Linux before I went to Fedora and later on to Linux Mint. Then, I switched to openSUSE for a while. Later on I switched to Arch Linux, which I used for a couple of months before I (finally) switched to my beloved [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). My Linux journey was a painstaking process in the beginning full of ups and downs. But I remained stubborn and once I switched to elementary OS I never looked back.

Even though I'm a Linux user, I'm not anti-Microsoft. I'm paying for a lot of their services. I have (a legal version of) Windows 8.1 laying around my hard drive (although I'm not really using it), I have a subscription to Microsoft's Office 365, I have a DreamSpark account and I have more than 1TB of space on OneDrive. I'm not using Linux because it's free as in beer, I'm using Linux because it's free as in speech (plus, it fits my needs way better then Windows).

I'm not really a smartphone user and I don't own a tablet. Sorry smartphones, but until something affordable and truly open (like Firefox OS or Ubuntu Mobile) becomes available in my country, I'm not throwing away my "dumbphone". The only piece of sophisticated tech equipment I have is my laptop. ([ASUS X54HR](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/X54HR/) with the best configuration available).

While I was in my teenager years, DJ-ing was my primary hobby. I had just recently decided to give up on my dream of becoming a worldly-known DJ (you can read why I decided to quit DJ-ing [here](https://r3bl.github.io/en/quitting-djing/)). I also did some amateur music production. I used to host it on SoundCloud before SoundCloud became unusable. Currently, I'm looking for some kind of a self-hosted SoundCoud-like alternative.

My biggest role model is [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). He truly was a genius of our time and I really like the way he thought. I do realize that he did some activities that are standing on the edge of what is considered as legal, but I strongly believe that he wasn't guilty. If he haven't committed suicide (which is his act which I, of course, don't support in any way), I believe that he would've proven his innocence in court. It's really a shame we lost such a great mind.

I'm not really an emotional person. I rarely take things emotionally. I like to get what I want from people and to give those people what they want, but I don't usually get too attached to them. I lived in three different cities over my life. I didn't really stay in contact with anyone from the previous cities I lived in. I started from scratch each time and adjusted myself to the new surrounding (and I will do the same as soon as I get a new opportunity). I don't have a best friend for life. I have a couple of good friends that are supporting me, but we're not really attached in a way that we can't continue our lives once our lives start to go in different directions.

I like giving back to my local community by participating in various volunteering opportunities. I even had the opportunity to spent a month in the Netherlands volunteering to their local community (in two cities: Rijswijk and Amsterdam) which was a life-changing experience to me. If you want to find out more about that, read [this blog post](http://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/).

[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/) is my dream company. I like what they're doing and I like the principles they're using. I have nothing but positive experience with working with people from Red Hat through my volunteering for the Opensource.com brand (which is sponsored by them).

I care about my privacy. I'm using [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as my search engine of choice (and I love it). I'm using Russian email service because I know that they have much smaller influence on my overall Internet experience than the more popular solutions (like GMail and Outlook). I'm using Mozilla's products ([Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/)) to explore the web and manage all of my email addresses (and I highly recommend those two products to everyone).

I'm a regular [Twitter user](https://twitter.com/r3bl_), [GitHub user](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/), [CareerDean user](https://www.careerdean.com/u/aleksandar-todorovi) and [Goodreads user](https://www.goodreads.com/). I occasionally use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandartodorovic) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aleksandar.todorovic.r3bl). I'm doing my best to be as productive as I can, but there's still a lot of things I can do to improve my daily workflow.
