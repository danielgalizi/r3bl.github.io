# Aleksandar TodoroviÄ‡ (Personal Blog)

This is the code behind my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll as a blogging platform.

This blog was previously hosted [on Wordpress.com domain](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/). If you're wondering how and why have I decided to do the transition, you can read  [this blog post](http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-switching-to-github-and-jekyll/). If you're wondering why I love GitHub so much, I suggest you to read [this article](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github) published on Opensource.com.

If you find some issues while browsing the site, please refer to [TODO.md](https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/blob/master/TODO.md) and check to see if I'm already planning on fixing the issue. If the issue is not mentioned on the list, feel free to report it [here](https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/issues).

For any kind of feedback, feel free to contact me on [aleksandar.todorovic@mail.ru](aleksandar.todorovic@mail.ru).

## Credits

I have to give credits to the people who made my website possible. I have only two proprietary features running (one of them is Disqus comments section and the second one is Google Analytics). The rest of the webpage is available thanks to the following projects and people:

* First of all, the amazing theme I'm using is called [HPSTR](https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) by [@mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes).
* My previous blog posts were imported from Wordpress to Jekyll using [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) by [@thomasf](https://github.com/thomasf).
* RSS feed made available thanks to the [jekyll-rss-feed](https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds) repository by [@snaptortuise](https://github.com/snaptortoise).

### Useful links

* If you're looking for a Jekyll theme to use on your website, you need to check [JekyllThemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/).
* If you don't know anything about Jekyll, but you're looking for a good place to start learning, I have to suggest [this great blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by [@joshualande](https://github.com/joshualande).
