I've decided to ditch the classic blogroll, so in this page, I will present you the list of _everything_ I like. This page is regularly updated, so keep an eye on it from time to time. I have to warn you that this is a pretty big list, so I decided to organize it into different categories.

## Software Pack

* **[elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/)** - elementary OS has been my favorite operating system for a long time now. Since I installed it for the first time, I never looked back. I love that sexy Pantheon Desktop Environment.
* **[Mozilla Firefox](https://affiliates.mozilla.org/referral/69489/)** - Mozilla Firefox is by far my favorite browser. I just can't imagine myself using anything else.
* **[Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/)** - When it comes to emailing, There's no tool that fits my needs better than Thunderbird.
* **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** - Atom is my favorite text editor. I use it for pretty much everything. It practically replaced my text editor, my IDE and my Office suite (in most of the cases).
* **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)** - LibreOffice is there when Atom can't get the job done. It's my favorite office pack and I really like using it. Plus, the design of LibreOffice is awesome once you switch your style to [sifr](http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/libreoffice-42-released-with-new.html).
* **[Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/)** - I got tired of all of those complicated to use to-do services and apps. That's why I switched to Todo.txt to keep myself organized. I'm using [QTodoTxt](https://github.com/mNantern/QTodoTxt) as a client on my elementary OS. There's also an awesome Atom package called [language-todotxt](https://atom.io/packages/language-todotxt) that I use regularly.
* **[Popcorn Time](http://popcorntime.io/)** - Everyone needs some relaxation, and that is when Popcorn Time steps in. A clean intuitive interface allows me to watch movies and TV shows any time I want to. Don't judge me, it's not my fault that there are no Netflix-like platforms available in my country. **EDIT**: Now that Popcorn Time is gone, I'm using [Stremio](http://strem.io/), which is a nice alternative.
* **[qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/)** - Why the hell does μTorrent have so many users when qBittorrent does the same job even better? Plus it has no ads and it's bundled with a few extra features such as sequential download. Unfortunately, Popcorn Time doesn't do a good job with actually seeding torrents, so I'm using qBittorrent to seed the things that I like.
* **[Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)** - When I'm doing something that requires from me to type commands inside of the terminal, Terminator is there to get the job done.
* **[TrueCrypt](https://truecrypt.ch/)** - Although officially not supported anymore, I'm still using it on a regular basis. I just can't find any Windows and Linux compatible software to get the job done better than TrueCrypt. There's currently no TrueCrypt fork that I completely trust (although I'm kind of starting to convince myself to switch to [VeraCrypt](http://veracrypt.codeplex.com/) completely).
* **[Spotify for Linux](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/previews/)** - Although I don't live in a country that Spotify supports, their geolocation blocking can be easily circumvented by firing up some VPN and changing your IP to a country supported by Spotify. Then, login to your Spotify account and you'll enter the "Vacation Mode" that will allow you to use Spotify for 14 days no matter where you are. Just repeat the procedure every 14 days and you're good to go.

## Web Services Pack

* **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - I love every single feature GitHub offers, which is why [GitHub is my favorite company](https://blog.r3bl.me/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/).
* **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/)** - I use Twitter regularly. It replaced Facebook as my "default" social network.
* **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)** - I tried DuckDuckGo once and now I can't get enough of it. I'm using it all of the time as my primary search engine, and I can't live without DuckDuckGo's [!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) any more.
* **[MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/)** - Even though I have over 2 TB of space available in the concurrent services (one terabyte on [Mail.Ru Cloud](https://cloud.mail.ru/) and another one on [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)), the cloud service that I use the most is MEGA, primarily because their Linux client works perfectly.
* **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)** - Hacker News is an excellent resource to keep up to date with the latest technology. I check it all of the time.
* **[Kindle](https://read.amazon.com/)** - I have over 200 books in my Kindle library and I enjoy reading them using online version of the Kindle Reader. Funny thing is I never actually payed for any of the books in my Kindle library ([hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks)).
* **[alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/)** - If you ever get tired of using a certain software and you're looking for alternatives, AlternativeTo is a place to go.
* **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)** - I strongly believe that education should be free and everyone who has the desire to learn should be able to finish courses offered by some of the best collages in the world. If you need to learn something new, Coursera is the place to go.
* **[edX](https://www.edx.org)** - edX is another service that allows you to participate in hundreds of courses for free. I love their cooperation with the open source community. They allow the creators of the course to publish their course under the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license and they have a great [Introduction to Linux](Never learned Linux? Want a refresh? Take this course free or get a verified certificate for $99 — Save 60% now!) course offered by the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

## Organizations and Foundations I Support

* **[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)** - I strongly believe that information should be free. That's why I'm releasing all of my articles under [CC-BY-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
* **[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)** - I strongly believe in the EFF as the defense mechanism for the Internet. I support almost every campaign they make and I completely trust that they know what's best for the privacy-aware Internet users.
* **[Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/)** - The foundation sponsoring the development of the Linux kernel. Linux took online collaboration to a whole new level and I think that it is great to have a foundation that allows Linux to become even better a day after day.
* **[The Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)** - I love Mozilla's goals and I'm using almost every product they're offering. The part that I especially like about them is [their Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/).
* **[SHARE Foundation](http://sharedefense.org/)** - Serbian nonprofit organization that supports privacy, free speech and transparency. They also have this amazing book called [Share This Book (2012)](http://www.shareconference.net/en/news/share-book).

## My Favorite Music

I love listening to electronic music. I've been DJ-ing throughout my teenage years (you can read the reasons why I decided to quit DJ-ing [here](https://r3bl.github.io/en/quitting-djing/)) and I got a chance to speak with some great musicians in the process. I also like listening to some hip-hop and rock occasionally.

### My Favorite Musicians

* **[Jack Ü](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtuGozGshjqqErhHGEmHnJw)** - I love this collaboration project between two icons of the electronic music: Skrillex and Diplo. They truly managed to make some wonderful songs together. I feel honored I was able to listen to their first set together in Europe during the [Kingsday Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lePNUXmvmIU) in Amsterdam in April 2015. My favorite songs: [To Ü feat. AlunaGeorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKqY3N20ZzE), [Where Are Ü Now (with Justin Bieber)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKS1xjqEv8o) and [Take Ü There feat. Kiesza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9slkeFXogU).
* **[Flume](https://www.youtube.com/user/FlumeAUS)** - Everything he touches he turns to pure gold. He makes the perfect relaxing electronic music breaking all of the genre barriers in the process. My favorite songs: [Some Minds feat. Andrew Wyatt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfLqsNRkBIo) and
[Disclosure - You & Me (Flume Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUkkaqSNduU).
* **[Tchami](https://www.youtube.com/user/TchamiTV)** - Thanks to his unique style, this guy managed to create the whole new sub-genre of House music called Future House. My favorite songs: [After Life feat. Stacy Barthe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGDVYt8qHDk), [Untrue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPHsToh4z3Y) and [Janet Jackson - Go Deep (Tchami Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ZdjwbQnXc).
* **[Kygo](https://www.youtube.com/user/KygoOfficialVEVO)** - This guy makes awesome Tropical House music. It truly was amazing listening to his set on a sunny afternoon during the already mentioned Kingsday Festival. My favorite songs: [Ed Sheeran - I See Fire (Kygo Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYc5tTvBlFE) and [Stole The Show feat. Parson James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfcToAjfdc).
* **[Marčelo](https://www.youtube.com/user/MarcheloOfficial)** - Marko Šelić (alias Marčelo) is a Serbian hip-hop star that talks about the things wrong in our society through his songs. He's also a journalist and an excellent writer. He published a couple of amazing books. My favorite songs: [Kostim (Raidov klaviRMX)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WwSV-Wat-4), [Testament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftQWCrd4Qkg) and [Nedođija BB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7sip1bldUg).
* **[Dubioza Kolektiv](https://www.youtube.com/user/dubiozatv)** - This is probably the most popular band in the world that originates from the Balkan region. In their lyrics, they're mocking the life in Bosnia & Herzegovina and surrounding countries. They managed to make Turbo Folk music (a pretty cheap genre of mainstream music popular in Serbia and its surrounding region) cool and they made an international carrier out of it. My favorite songs: [No Escape (from Balkan)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtgA0jvhp2A), [Free.mp3 (The Pirate Bay Song)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS8-nNhWlw4) and [Krivo je more 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAX5DqEUGck).
* **[S.A.R.S](https://www.youtube.com/user/sarsupload)** - It's an excellent Serbian band. Their name is an acronym and it means Svježe Amputirana Ruka Satrijanija (eng. Freshly Amputated Hand of Joe Satriani). My favorite songs: [Klovn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su7ff5hnY-M), [Mir i ljubav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx1fiU2vgN0) and [Lutka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Ms56gX-Tc).
* **[Disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/user/DisclosureVEVO)** - English electronic duo that just makes _the most perfect_ electronic music. Period. My favorite songs: [White Noise feat. AlunaGeorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkk2H3Ztrfk) (also my favorite song of all times) and [Latch feat. Sam Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ASUImTedo).
* **[Gramatik](https://www.youtube.com/user/Gramatikk)** - Slovenian producer that makes amazing chilling instrumental hip-hop music. Oh, and he also releases his _entire_ discography for free through torrents. My favorite songs: [Brave Men (feat. Eskobars)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA5SfGNZCrU), [Who Got Juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjeHMY8w8zY) and [No Shortcuts (Intro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCkCPfDmqQ) (which is also my favorite inspirational song).

### My Favorite Albums

Since there's a lot of albums I wanted to include in this list, I divided the list in two pieces: albums in English language and albums in Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian language.

#### English Albums

I didn't listen to a lot of English albums, but I just _had_ to select a couple of them that I particularly enjoy listening to.

* **[Dillon Francis - Money Sucks, Friends Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrVFjPl2Whg&list=PLCa6rr7iYzFUp-R2CRnWNSevhn4KdxBz4)** - Dillon Francis really managed to turn the electronic scene upside down. I love this album. Favorite songs: [Get Low feat. DJ Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12CeaxLiMgE) and [I Can't Take It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKchw7cfdA).
* **[The xx - Coexist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nW5AF0m9Zw&list=PLadHJ3xCi0cnjzPXsA5H7JnnMDZumqZ2E)** - Nice chilling album that makes you question your whole life while you're listening to it. Favorite songs: [Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nW5AF0m9Zw&list=PLadHJ3xCi0cnjzPXsA5H7JnnMDZumqZ2E) and [Unfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlAQJH_91dE&list=PLadHJ3xCi0cnjzPXsA5H7JnnMDZumqZ2E&index=9).
* **[Gramatik - The Age of Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5EgF8Vjfs&list=PL7-NrfuNPRyxMNj7AFcG4CuTR3q2qGjE9)** - Favorite Gramatik's album. Full of great instrumental hip-hop tracks. Favorite tracks: [Brave Men (feat. Eskobars)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5EgF8Vjfs&list=PL7-NrfuNPRyxMNj7AFcG4CuTR3q2qGjE9) and [We Used to Dream (feat. Exmag & Gibbz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK9HrXt5Ups&list=PL7-NrfuNPRyxMNj7AFcG4CuTR3q2qGjE9&index=5).
* **[Disclosure - Settle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nsKDJlpUbA&list=PLJQWzHDcKFC1g0pxjlUNOCWN32QTrPq3c)** - A game-changing album by Disclosure. Definitely worth a listen. Favorite songs: [When A Fire Starts To Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nsKDJlpUbA&list=PLJQWzHDcKFC1g0pxjlUNOCWN32QTrPq3c) and [White Noise feat. AlunaGeorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkk2H3Ztrfk&index=4&list=PLJQWzHDcKFC1g0pxjlUNOCWN32QTrPq3c).
* **[Rudimental - Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcOUKuo8pg)** - Amazing album by a great English drum 'n' bass band. Favorite songs: [Feel the Love (feat. John Newman)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcOUKuo8pg) and [Waiting All Night (feat. Ella Eyre)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M97vR2V4vTs) (there's also [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSXJVMU3OFlk) of them preforming this song live for BBC Radio 1).
* **[Waka Flocka - Flockaveli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4vB5UQ1BRE&list=PL42CF75CE02AD10F8)** - This list would not be complete without at least one hard hip-hop album. I decided to include this one by the legendary Waka Flocka. Favorite songs: [Bricksquad (feat. Gudda Gudda)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BkjJmdTLsA&list=PL42CF75CE02AD10F8&index=6) and [Grove St. Party (feat. Kebo Gotti)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLeLo6Ud1ao&list=PL42CF75CE02AD10F8&index=9).

#### Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian Albums

* **[Kendi - Van dometa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7-qQVx5oU&list=PL78w5GiH56nGVE8s14iAPimi_lGCXlEF1)** - Kendi, prethodno poznat kao Cantwait, je napravio fantastičan album prvijenac. Album je pun odličnih pjesama koje savršeno odgovaraju ljetnjim danima. Od prve do zadnje pjesme, album je čista uživancija. Najdraže pjesme: [Alhemičar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q6QeLs8uDo&list=PL78w5GiH56nGVE8s14iAPimi_lGCXlEF1&index=2), [Van dometa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glMvSv8MEqU&list=PL78w5GiH56nGVE8s14iAPimi_lGCXlEF1&index=8) i [Zagonetka feat. Eeva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMORmI_s6cU&index=13&list=PL78w5GiH56nGVE8s14iAPimi_lGCXlEF1).
* **[Marčelo - Napet šou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WV1q2n8xzQ&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI)** - Ovo je ubjedljivo moj najdraži album. Marčelo je uspio da se uzdigne na novi nivo sa ovim albumom. Svaka pjesma ima posebno značenje, svaka pjesma priča svoju priču, ali bez obzira na to Marčelo je uspio da stvori jednu cjelinu. Uz album je izdao i odličnu knjigu kroz koju je podijelio proces nastajanja albuma i nekoliko odličnih članaka o tome šta zapravo predstavlja ovaj album. Najdraže pjesme: [Laž feat. Ministar Lingvista](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5eTBX0up8&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI&index=3), [Himna Maršala Mita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PCFm64Tzv0&index=5&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI), [Tunel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRXul3z0-Z4&index=8&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI), [20.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsExaeNuhEQ&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI&index=4) i [Komplikovani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgSx1K9m5_k&index=11&list=PL98KSlfIIlryiqvdobQSoOu30hz_f3gMI) (nisam bezveze napisao da mi je ovo najdraži album).
* **[S.A.R.S - Ikone pop kulture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ50j34m3jg&list=PLgTChPsGVIU75Qm24WGJd85GKd-WhkXrU)** - Četvrti album grupe S.A.R.S, prepun odličnih tekstova, laganih ritmova i zanimljivih pogleda na društvo. Najdraže pjesme: [Dane brojim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ50j34m3jg&list=PLgTChPsGVIU75Qm24WGJd85GKd-WhkXrU) i [Ikone pop kulture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlU2uPE8Lgc&list=PLgTChPsGVIU75Qm24WGJd85GKd-WhkXrU&index=4).
* **[Kontra - Igra Riječi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BxBYGjjrb8&list=PLtpqbtQ2yqIUP5HvvxRaB9eh3tpIYVNr9)** - Dugo se čekao album prvijenac jednog od najpoznatijih bosanskih repera. Kada smo ga dočekali, uspio je da pomete konkurenciju. Najdraže pjesme: [Monstrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvQqPZhvELA&index=5&list=PLtpqbtQ2yqIUP5HvvxRaB9eh3tpIYVNr9) i [Heroji 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXKPtaZbNWE&index=9&list=PLtpqbtQ2yqIUP5HvvxRaB9eh3tpIYVNr9).
* **[Kurtoazija - Iz svemira](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmd9OpbPvb9ahe6Ja3DArpzmWtELKg_E7)** - Odličan album beogradske hip-hop grupe Kurtoazija. Većina tekstova se bavi "drugom stranom zakona" gdje na šaljiv način opisuju svakodnevnicu osoba koje nisu baš sklone življenju po zakonima. Zarazni ritmovi i dobar flow prate čitav album. Najdraže pjesme: [Nećemo u centar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcbwRU5i40A&index=5&list=PLmd9OpbPvb9ahe6Ja3DArpzmWtELKg_E7) i [Ima da gori (feat. Gazda Paja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7chAV_nN_8k&list=PLmd9OpbPvb9ahe6Ja3DArpzmWtELKg_E7&index=20).

## My Favorite Books

I'm trying to move away from Goodreads because... well, why the heck would I want to use yet another web service for something that I could literally do [in a text file](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/00_books.md)? So, in that text file you can see every book I have read (or at least, every book I remember reading), every book I'm currently reading and every book I'm planning on reading.

Below, I'll just list some of my favorites:

* **[The Armageddon Rag by George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67948.The_Armageddon_Rag)** - In this novel, George R.R. Martin managed to create the perfect blend between the hippie culture and mythology. I highly recommend this book to every fan of fiction.
* **[The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573607.The_God_Delusion)** - I completely gave up on the religion a couple of years ago when I realized that I was actually afraid to acknowledge that the theory of religion has so many flaws that it can't be true. This book convinced me that I was right all along and because of this book I'm no longer ashamed to call myself an atheist. Actually, I'm proud of it.
* **[Animal Farm by George Orwell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7613.Animal_Farm)** - I read this excellent satire a couple of times. It's the perfect satire of the socialist/communist philosophy of Stalin in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, I still haven't read 1984 by George Orwell, but it's on the top of my reading list.
* **[Napet šou (eng. Tense Show) by Marko Šelić](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23295356-napet-ou)** - I had already mentioned Marko Šelić in the music section of this page. This book is a perfect addition to his excellent music album called Napet šou.
* **[A Song of Ice and Fire Series by George R.R. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)** - I love _everything_ about this book series. George managed to create an amazing world full of exciting things like magic and dragons. I love the fact that in his world, it's not all about the war like in the rest of the fantasy books (yes, I'm talking about Tolkien). Every character has an interesting story and interesting personality and you never know who's good and who's bad.
* **[Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)** - Harry Potter's books were my favorite while I was growing up. I loved getting lost in the Harry's world. The last book in this series was also the first book I have read in English.
